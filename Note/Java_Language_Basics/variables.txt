Rules : 
1. It can only start with letters,_ or $ but letters are a convention.
2. For numeric Constant we use NUM_VALUE like format. This where _ is generally used.
3. The $ sign is generally for the generated variables so we dont use it.

There are four types of variables : 
1.Instance Variable (Non static vaiables) : The variables whose value is dynamically inputted. The variables used to store the fields of objs are this type.
2.Static Variables : These use the keyword static. The variable is once declared and defined and its copy is used whenever needed.The Fields which needs to be consistent  across all objs in a class use this variable.
3.local Variable : Declared and defined within a block of code and its scope is limited to the same.
4.parameters : The variables passed to function(method) calls.

Primitive Variables:
1.int : used to store 4 byte integer (2s complement signed)
2.short : 2 byte (2s complement signed)
3.long : 8byte signed integer. needs a L at end
4.float : TO store floating point variables . needs an f at end
5.double : to store floating point 64bit integer.
6.char : to store a single ascii character
7.byte : to store 8 bit interger
8.boolean : 1 bit for true/false.

Reference Variables : Unlike the primitive variables which store the value , these store the address of the variables(objects).

Underscores can be used in int/float literals to deocumentation or readibility.
eg : 52_232, 3.14_15fetc but _21 , 3._14f 3._14f, 3.14_f , is invalid


Some note on class/static variables:
The need for static variables : There are few parameters that we need to keep updated which objects need not know.
Say we may need to keep track of no of objects we could use class variables.

In case of class variables its recommended to not create an object rather to access/modify it use this : className.classVariableName
