The method defination has following components :
1. The modifiers (eg public , private ,etc)
2. return type of the method. 
3.the method name (convention is to use verb first letter small)
4. method's parameter variables with their datatype and var_name with ()
5. exceptions (discussed later).
6. method body within {} which has the code for performing the method.

method declarations involve methodname and parameters with the datatype.

Overloading of methods :
The methods can have same name within a class given they dont have same number of variables and same data type.
