The objects are created as follows : 
declaration , instantiation , initialisation.
eg : class_name obj_name = new constructor_name(parameters if any)
Using objects:
1. If accessiing the variables or fields within its own class you can simply use it
2. If the variable is a field within another class then we have to use the dot operator
syntax : objectCreatedForThatClass.variableToAccess
