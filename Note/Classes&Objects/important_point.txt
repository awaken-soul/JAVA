In JAVA  everything is pass-by-value. A copy of the variable/object is passed not the og but there is a catch.
For reference objects the value passed is the address to the object thus a copy of object but pointing to the same object thus any change to the object alters the og object.
Dont leave look if you CHANGE THE COPY OBJECT BY REASSIGNING IT TO A NEW OBJECT then it will no longer have address to the og object thus any further changes wont affect the og object.
