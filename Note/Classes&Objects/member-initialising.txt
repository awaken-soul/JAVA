Not always does the variable to be initialised has the value available it may need looping constructs or conditional statements.
For instance variables it can be done using constructor but for class variable we need something as follows:
static {
    ..... code comes here for initialisation of the static variables.
  } 
This is called static initialisation block.
Another method to initalize a class variable is using private static method :
class ohhyeah {
  private static point = initializeClassVariables();
  private static initializeClassVariables () {
  // initialize code here 
}


NOOOOTEEE : The static block content cant be redefined and cant be prevented from executing.When using file handling or network be careful.


Initialising the instance variale
1. initialiser block : { ... }
2. using final : its pretty useful as it cant be overridden in subclass so it helps in initialising the variables which needs to be for sub classes

eg : class hellyeah {
    private zaddie = intialiseZaddie();
    private final zaddieinitializer() {
      ....
    }
